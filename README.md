# Introduction
This repo contains a collection of mods that I have made for the game Grocery Store Simulator.

# Mods

## Box Destroyer
This mod aims to make box cleanup a breeze! Any empty boxes lying on the ground will be deleted when you press Ctrl + F7. Empty boxes on storage shelves will not be deleted.

The keybind is configurable in the config.lua file similar to other mods.

### Known Issues/Future Work
- Currently, if you are carrying an item the the process is aborted. This is because if you are holding an empty box and it is deleted, then you won't be able to pick something up until you go to menu and reload your save.
